## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 🔹 Task 1: Data Preparation
- Imported HR data from Excel
- Renamed columns for readability (e.g., `Monthly_Income` → `Monthly Income`)
- Corrected data types (categorical vs numeric)
- Removed duplicates
- Handled nulls using context-aware techniques (e.g., mean imputation for `YearsWithCurrentManager`)

---

### 🔹 Task 2: KPI Creation
Created **KPI Cards** using DAX for:
- **Total Employees** = COUNT(EmployeeNumber)
- **Attrition Rate** = (Employees Left / Total Employees) × 100
- **Average Monthly Income** = AVERAGE(Monthly Income)

All KPIs are formatted with consistent style and placed at the top of the report for quick viewing.
